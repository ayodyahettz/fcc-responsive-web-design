            <p><b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web
                It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML
                are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
                or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p>
                "HyperText" refers to links the connect web pages to one another,
                either within a single website or between websites. Links are a 
                fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet 
                and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active 
                participant in the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for 
                display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such 
                as <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code>, 
                <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;search&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
                and many others. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which
                consist of the element name surrounded by <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. 
                The name of an element inside a tag is case-sensitive. That is, it can be written 
                in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> 
                tag can be written as <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, or in any other 
                way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

                HTML (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is the code that is used to structure 
                a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured wirhin a set of paragraphs, a 
                list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will 
                give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

            <header><h2>What is HTML</h2></header>
            <p>
                HTML is a <i>markup language</i> that defines the structure of your 
                content. HTML consists of a series of <a href="#elements">elements</a>, 
                which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make 
                it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing <a href="#tags">tags</a> 
                can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can 
                make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For Example, take the following 
                line of content:
            </p>
            
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        
            <p>
                If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that 
                it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
            </p>
        
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header><h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2></header>
            <p>
                Let's explore this paragraph element. The main parts of our 
                element are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists fo the name of 
                    the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and 
                    closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element 
                    begins or starts to take effect - in this case, where the paragraph 
                    begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except 
                    that it includes a <i>forward slash</i> before the element name. This 
                    states where the element ends - in this case where the paragraph ends.
                    Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and 
                    can lead to strange results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this 
                    case, is just text.                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content 
                    together comprise the element.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have Attributes that contain extra information 
                about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
                <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> are examples of attribute names.   
            </p>
            <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, 
                    if the element already has one or more attributes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The attribute name followed by an equal sign
                </li>
                <li>
                    The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
                </li>
            </ol>

            
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_Elements">
            <header><h2>Nesting Elements</h2></header>
            <p>
                You can put elements inside other elements too - this is called 
                <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state that our cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, 
                we could wrap the word "very" in a <code><a href="#strong-element">&lt;strong&gt;</a></code> 
                element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly 
                nested. In the example above, we opened the <code><a href="#p-element">&lt;p&gt;</a></code> 
                element first, then the <code><a href="#strong-element">&lt;strong&gt;</a></code> 
                element; therefore, we have to close the <code><a href="#strong-element">&lt;strong&gt;</a></code> 
                element first, then the <code><a href="#p-element">&lt;p&gt;</a></code> element. The following is incorrect:
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly 
                inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your 
                web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, 
                which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
            </p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Void_Elements">
            <header><h2>Void Elements</h2></header>
            <p>
                Some elements have no content and are called <a href="#Void-Elements"><b>void elements</b></a>. 
            Take the <code><a href="#img">img</a></code> element that we already have in our HTML page
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Test image" /&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag 
                and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect 
                it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
            </p>

            <p>
                That wraps up the basics of HTML elements, but they aren't handy 
                on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined 
                to form an entire HTML page.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html lang="en-us&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;
                &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;Test Page&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Test Image"/&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt; 
        &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> - Is a required
                    preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young 
                    (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a 
                    set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, 
                    which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
                    However, these days, they  don't do much and are basically just needed to 
                    make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> - The <code><a href="#html-element">&lt;html&gt;</a></code> 
                    This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known 
                    as the root element. It also includes the <code>lang</code> attribute, setting 
                    the primary language of the document.
                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> - The <code><a href="#head-element">&lt;head&gt;</a></code> 
                    element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include 
                    on the HTML page that <i>isn't</i> the content you are showing to your page's 
                    viewer's. This includes things like <a href="#keywords">keywords</a> and a page description  
                    that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character 
                    set declarations, and more.
                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> - This element sets the character set 
                    should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
                    Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.
                    There is no reason not to see this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code> - This viewport element 
                    ensures the  page renders at the width of the viewport, preventing mobile browsers 
                    from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> - The <code><a href="#title-element">&lt;title&gt;</a></code> element. This 
                    sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is 
                    loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code></li> - The <code><a href="#body-element">&lt;body&gt;</a></code> element. This 
                contains <i>all</i> the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text 
                images, video games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
