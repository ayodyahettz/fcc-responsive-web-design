                 Norwegian parents Harald and Sophie Magdalene Dahl.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1920: </b>Roald's eldest sibling Astri dies from appendicitis at the age of seven. 
                His father passes away from pneumonia shortly afterward. Roald was only three.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1934: </b>Roald crosses the Atlantic on the RMS <i>Nova Scotia</i>. He joined the 
                Shell Petroleum Company.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1936: </b>Following two years of training with Shell, Dahl is assigned to Mombasa, Kenya, 
                followed by Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika. His many experiences during this period are colourfully 
                detailed in his autobiography written in his later years, <i>'Going Solo'.</i>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1939: </b>In August, Dahl is commissioned into the King's African Rifles as a Lieutenant during the 
                second world war. He was assigned to command indigenous troops that served for the British 
                Empire.
                <br>
                Roald joins the Royal AirForce as an aircraftman in November, his service number being 774022.
                It was after a 600-mile journey on car from Dar-es-Salaam to Nairobi that he was accepted for 
                flight training with sixteen others. He flies a De Havilland Tiger Moth solo, with only seven 
                hours and 40 minutes of experience. Of the seventeen trainees, only three survived the war.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1940: </b>Dahl is commissioned as a pilot officer, and was deemed eligible to join a 
                squadron that faced the enemy.
                <br>
                With no specialized training in aerial combat or flying obsolete Gloster Gladiators, Roald was 
                ordered to fly with his squadron in stages. Unable to find the airstrip in the final leg while running
                low on fuel, he was forced to land on the desert, resulting in a crash. His skull gets fractured and 
                nose is broken while being blinded temporarily. Luckily, he managed to get away from the wreckage before 
                losing consciousness.
                <br>
                He gets rescued and regains hsi consciousness, but not his eyesight. He is transported by train to 
                Alexandria. It was later revealed that the location he was told to fly was wrong, and that he was mistakenly 
                assigned to fly to the No Man's Land between the Italian and Allied forces.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><b>1946: </b>The RAF invalidates Dahl from service after being pronounced unfit. He held the post

                development of the 'Wade-Dahl-Till' valve, a device used to alleviate the condition. It was later 
                successfully used on thousands of children around the world.

            <li><b>1962: </b>Dahl's daughter Olivia dies at the age of seven due to measles encephalitis.</li>
