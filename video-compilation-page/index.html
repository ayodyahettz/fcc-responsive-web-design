        <h1>Quantum Physics 101</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the most mind-bending, reality-warping, particle-twirling
            ride of your life. Quantum Physics: where things are both here and 
            there, and your cat might be alive, dead, or really just confused.

            <h2>Superposition: Both Here and There (Like Your Socks)</h2>
            <p>
                In the everyday world, things are pretty boring: your coffee is 
                either hot or cold, your lights either on or off, and your socks are 
                either on your feet or missing in the laundry void. But in the 
                quantum world, particles don't play by those rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Superposition is the idea that a particle can exist in <b>multiple states at once</b>. 
                An electron, for example, can be spinning clockwise and anti-clockwise at the same time, 
                until we measure it. The moment we peek, the particle "Chooses" a state, like a kid 
                finally deciding on ice cream after staring at the menu for an hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most famous example? Schrödinger's Cat. Picture a cat in a box that's hooked up 
                to some random quantum event. Until you open the box, the cat is both alive and dead, 
                simlutaneously, because that's how quantum probabilities work. Don't worry though, no 
                actual cats were harmed in the making of this though experiment.

            <h2>Entanglement: The Cosmic BFFs</h2>
            <p>
                Quantum Entanglement is like a magical friendship. Two particles become 
                so connected that changing one instantly affects the other, no matter 
                how far apart they are. It's the universe saying "Distance? Never heard 
                of it."

            <h2>Wave-Particle Duality: The Shape-Shifter Show</h2>
            <p>
                Particles can act like both tiny balls and waves. It's like if your 
                pen could decide to be a spaghetti strand whenever you weren't looking— 
                messy, confusing, and strangely beautiful.
