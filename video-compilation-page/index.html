        <h1>Quantum Physics 101</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the most mind-bending, reality-warping, particle-twirling
            ride of your life. Quantum Physics: where things are both here and 
            there, and your cat might be alive, dead, or really just confused.

            <h2>Superposition: Both Here and There (Like Your Socks)</h2>
            <p>
                In the everyday world, things are pretty boring: your coffee is 
                either hot or cold, your lights either on or off, and your socks are 
                either on your feet or missing in the laundry void. But in the 
                quantum world, particles don't play by those rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Superposition is the idea that a particle can exist in <b>multiple states at once</b>. 
                An electron, for example, can be spinning clockwise and anti-clockwise at the same time, 
                until we measure it. The moment we peek, the particle "Chooses" a state, like a kid 
                finally deciding on ice cream after staring at the menu for an hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most famous example? Schr√∂dinger's Cat. Picture a cat in a box that's hooked up 
                to some random quantum event. Until you open the box, the cat is both alive and dead, 
                simlutaneously, because that's how quantum probabilities work. Don't worry though, no 
                actual cats were harmed in the making of this though experiment.

            <h2>Entanglement: The Cosmic BFFs</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you and your best friend each have a pair of cosmic walkie-talkies. 
                No matter how apart you are - across the street, across the country, or 
                across the galaxy, your walkie-talkies always give you instant matching messages. 
                That's kind of how <b>Quantum Entanglement</b> works.
            </p>
            <p>
                When two particles become entangled, they form a special connnection. Measuring 
                one particle instantly determines the state of the other, even if they're light 
                years apart. Einstein didn't like this at all. He called it "spooky action at a 
                distance", which is basically physics-speak for "WTF".
            </p>
            <p>
                Entanglement isn't just weird, it's useful. It's the backbone of futuristic tech 
                like <b>quantum computing</b> (super powerful computers that use qubits instead 
                of boring old bits) and <b>quantum teleportation</b> (don't get over excited, it's 
                not Star Trek style, but it's still impressive). In short, entanglement proves that 
                the universe likes drama and long-distance relationships.

            <h2>Wave-Particle Duality: The Shape-Shifter Show</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, this one's a classic. For centuries, scientists argued: are light and particles 
                like tiny billiard balls or wavy ripples? The quantum answer: <b>both</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the <b>double-slit experiment</b>. Fire particles, like electrons, at a barrier with 
                two slits. You'd expect them to form two neat piles, right? Wrong. They create an interference 
                pattern, like waves overlapping in a pond. The crazy part? If you try to watch which slit 
                the particle goes through, the interference disappears, and the particle behaves like a solid 
                little dot again. It's Toy Story in a nutshell.
            </p>
            <p>
                This wave-particle duality tells us that quantum objects are <b>Shape-Shifters</b>. Sometimes 
                they act like waves, sometimes like particles, and sometimes both at once. It's like your 
                pen suddenly deciding to moonlight as a piece of spaghetti when you weren't paying attention - 
                confusing, but also a little delicious.
