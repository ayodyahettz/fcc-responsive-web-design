        <h1>Quantum Physics 101</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the most mind-bending, reality-warping, particle-twirling
            ride of your life. Quantum Physics: where things are both here and 
            there, and your cat might be alive, dead, or really just confused.

            <h2>Entanglement: The Cosmic BFFs</h2>
            <p>
                Quantum Entanglement is like a magical friendship. Two particles become 
                so connected that changing one instantly affects the other, no matter 
                how far apart they are. It's the universe saying "Distance? Never heard 
                of it."

            <h2>Wave-Particle Duality: The Shape-Shifter Show</h2>
            <p>
                Particles can act like both tiny balls and waves. It's like if your 
                pen could decide to be a spaghetti strand whenever you weren't looking— 
                messy, confusing, and strangely beautiful.
